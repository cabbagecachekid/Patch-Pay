# Product Overview

This is a financial optimization system that calculates optimal money transfer routes between accounts. The system analyzes multiple source accounts and finds the best paths to transfer funds to a target account, balancing three key factors: cost (fees), speed (arrival time), and risk (timing, reliability, complexity).

The system returns three categorized routes—cheapest, fastest, and recommended—allowing users to make informed decisions based on their priorities and deadlines.
